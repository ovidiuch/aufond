  ensureSubmitButton: ->
    ###
      HACK a <form> only get submitted by the RETURN key if a submit button is
      present. Since a form can be inside a modal w/ the submit button outside
      itself, or can use a styled anchor to trigger the submit, we need to
      plant an invisible submit button in any form template in order to make
      sure we still trigger the native behavior
    ###

      $submitButton = $('<input type="submit">').attr('tabindex', -1)
      # XXX make sure submit button isn't visible and doesn't affect the layout
      # in any way
      $submitButton.css
        position: 'absolute'
        visibility: 'hidden'
        left: -9999
      @view.$el.find('form').append($submitButton)
