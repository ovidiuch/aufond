      <p>We&mdash;and by <em>we</em> I mean the dude that made this app&mdash;are sorry to see you go, but it's not the end of the world. To make your departure safer you'll receive an export of all your entries in an email (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> format); but of course, <strong>only if you have one email address submitted in your account</strong> (a few pixels up)</p>
