        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>This is a working prototype and there is only one person behind it. No startup, company or even team. I am a programmer by trade, with a profound passion for user experience.</p>
        <p>This started as a personal need, I wanted a place to call my own. A place where my personal data would serve me and not the platform. I took a shot at designing a static template for myself and put it out there. After getting positive feedback, that led to thinking that others could also benefit from it, so I decided to turn it into an online service. One that empowers users by getting out of their way as much as possible.</p>
        <p>If enough users submit to this, I might eventually seek profit through a side product or feature, in order to create a sustainable environment. That being said, everything that is already offered (and probably more) will always be free. Also, ads will never be an option.</p>

        <p class="thanks">PS. Thanks to Derek Sivers for allowing me to showcase a profile based on his life!</p>
